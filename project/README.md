#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/IsTbzpvervQ
#### Description: This project is a currency exchange rate calculator.
It takes an csv sheet that can be downloaded from the US Federal Exchange
and using Pandas, cleans it up and puts the reorganized information into
a new csv. This new reformatted csv is then used in a series of python
functions that converts the currencies to or from USD.
