# Jose's CS50 Course

This is the github repository where all my CS50 work is stored. It shows what I learned over the 10 weeks of learning through Harvard's CS50 course. 
In here is C, Python, HTML, and JS. I learned a lot about CS fundementals that have helped me tremendously on my journey to become a programmer.
